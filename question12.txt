Which clustering method would you prefer when analyzing these data sets? Provide a summary of each method's strengths and weaknesses on these data sets in the three areas considered in this application. Your summary should be at least a paragraph in length (4 sentences minimum).

Looking at the data sets we were given I would have to say I prefer k-means clustering.  The main reason is that I would prefer a method that scales.  K-means was far faster than hierarchical, which is going to be important on larger data sets.  What's more, the main advantage I saw for hierarchical clustering was that it had lower distortions, but that was only true in smaller data sets.  In question 10 we saw that as we increased the data set size the benefit that hierarchical cluster had in lower distortions seemed to completely evaporate.  For those reasons, I think k-means would be the better method to use unless one is working solely with small sized data sets.

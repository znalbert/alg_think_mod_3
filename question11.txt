For each data set (111, 290, and 896 counties), does one clustering method consistently produce lower distortion clusterings when the number of output clusters is in the range 6 to 20? Is so, indicate on which data set(s) one method is superior to the other.

For 111 hierarchical_clustering consistently had lower distortion.

For 290 there were a couple points where k-means clustering had lower distortion, but for the majority of the time hierarchical had lower distortion.

For 896 the distortion seemed to bounce back and forth between the two clustering methods.
